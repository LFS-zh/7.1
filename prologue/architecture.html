      </h1>
      <p>
      LFS 的主要目标架构是 32 位的Intel CPU。如果你之前没有构建过LFS系统，你应该从这个
        目标（在 32 位的Intel CPU 上构建一个 LFS 系统）开始。32 位架构是得到 Linux 系统支持
        最广泛的处理器体系，而且对开源和专有软件的兼容性都是最好的。
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the instructions in this book are known to work,
        with some modifications, with both Power PC and 64-bit AMD/Intel
        CPUs. To build a system that utilizes one of these CPUs, the main
        prerequisite, in addition to those on the next few pages, is an
        existing Linux system such as an earlier LFS installation, Ubuntu,
        Red Hat/Fedora, SuSE, or other distribution that targets the
        architecture that you have. Also note that a 32-bit distribution can
        be installed and used as a host system on a 64-bit AMD/Intel
        computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other facts about 64-bit systems need to be added here. When
        compared to a 32-bit system, the sizes of executable programs are
        slightly larger and the execution speeds are only slightly faster.
        For example, in a test build of LFS-6.5 on a Core2Duo CPU based
        system, the following statistics were measured:
      </p>
      <pre class="screen"><code class=
      "computeroutput">Architecture Build Time     Build Size 
32-bit       198.5 minutes  648 MB 
64-bit       190.6 minutes  709 MB</code></pre>
      <p>
        As you can see, the 64-bit build is only 4% faster and is 9% larger
        than the 32-bit build. The gain from going to a 64-bit system is
        relatively minimal. Of course, if you have more than 4GB of RAM or
        want to manipulate data that exceeds 4GB, the advantages of a 64-bit
        system are substantial.
      </p>
      <p>
        The default 64-bit build that results from LFS is considered a "pure"
        64-bit system. That is, it supports 64-bit executables only. Building
        a "multi-lib" system requires compiling many applications twice, once
        for a 32-bit system and once for a 64-bit system. This is not
        directly supported in LFS because it would interfere with the
        educational objective of providing the instructions needed for a
        straightforward base Linux system. You can refer to the <a class=
        "ulink" href="http://trac.cross-lfs.org/">Cross Linux From
        Scratch</a> project for this advanced topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is one last comment about 64-bit systems. There are some
        packages that cannot currently be built in a "pure" 64-bit system or
        require specialized build instructions. Generally, these packages
        have some embedded 32-bit specific assembly language instructions
        that fail when building on a 64-bit system. This includes some Xorg
        drivers from <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/">Beyond Linux From
        Scratch (BLFS)</a>. Many of these problems can be worked around, but
        may require some specialized procedures or patches.
