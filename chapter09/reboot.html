        the System
      </h1>
      <p>
        Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to reboot
        your computer. However, you should be aware of a few things. The
        system you have created in this book is quite minimal, and most
        likely will not have the functionality you would need to be able to
        continue forward. By installing a few extra packages from the BLFS
        book while still in our current chroot environment, you can leave
        yourself in a much better position to continue on once you reboot
        into your new LFS installation. Installing a text mode web browser,
        such as Lynx, you can easily view the BLFS book in one virtual
        terminal, while building packages in another. The GPM package will
        also allow you to perform copy/paste actions in your virtual
        terminals. Lastly, if you are in a situation where static IP
        configuration does not meet your networking requirements, installing
        packages such as Dhcpcd or PPP at this point might also be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have said that, lets move on to booting our shiny new LFS
        installation for the first time! First exit from the chroot
        environment:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">logout</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Then unmount the virtual file systems:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">umount -v $LFS/dev/pts
umount -v $LFS/dev/shm
umount -v $LFS/dev
umount -v $LFS/proc
umount -v $LFS/sys</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Unmount the LFS file system itself:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">umount -v $LFS</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        If multiple partitions were created, unmount the other partitions
        before unmounting the main one, like this:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">umount -v $LFS/usr
umount -v $LFS/home
umount -v $LFS</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Now, reboot the system with:
      </p>
      <pre class="userinput"><kbd class="command">shutdown -r now</kbd></pre>
      <p>
        Assuming the GRUB boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the
        menu is set to boot <span class="emphasis"><em>LFS 7.1</em></span>
        automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and more
        software may be added to suit your needs.
