      </h1>
      <p>
        Most packages provide a test suite. Running the test suite for a
        newly built package is a good idea because it can provide a
        &ldquo;<span class="quote">sanity check</span>&rdquo; indicating that
        everything compiled correctly. A test suite that passes its set of
        checks usually proves that the package is functioning as the
        developer intended. It does not, however, guarantee that the package
        is totally bug free.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some test suites are more important than others. For example, the
        test suites for the core toolchain packages&mdash;GCC, Binutils, and
        Glibc&mdash;are of the utmost importance due to their central role in
        a properly functioning system. The test suites for GCC and Glibc can
        take a very long time to complete, especially on slower hardware, but
        are strongly recommended.

        <p>
          Experience has shown that there is little to be gained from running
          the test suites in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter
          5</a>. There can be no escaping the fact that the host system
          always exerts some influence on the tests in that chapter, often
          causing inexplicable failures. Because the tools built in <a class=
          "xref" href="../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter
          5</a> are temporary and eventually discarded, we do not recommend
          running the test suites in <a class="xref" href=
          "../chapter05/chapter05.html" title=
          "Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Constructing a Temporary System">Chapter
          5</a> for the average reader. The instructions for running those
          test suites are provided for the benefit of testers and developers,
          but they are strictly optional.
        </p>

      <p>
        A common issue with running the test suites for Binutils and GCC is
        running out of pseudo terminals (PTYs). This can result in a high
        number of failing tests. This may happen for several reasons, but the
        most likely cause is that the host system does not have the
        <code class="systemitem">devpts</code> file system set up correctly.
        This issue is discussed in greater detail at <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org//lfs/faq.html#no-ptys">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org//lfs/faq.html#no-ptys</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes package test suites will fail, but for reasons which the
        developers are aware of and have deemed non-critical. Consult the
        logs located at <a class="ulink" href=
        "http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/7.1/">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/build-logs/7.1/</a>
        to verify whether or not these failures are expected. This site is
        valid for all tests throughout this book.
